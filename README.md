# Project Title

This project is my very first coding project. It's fairly simple in nature--I was asked to make the website more accessible and clean up the code. This involved properly formatting elements, adding semantic elements, commenting to organize the CSS file, and fixing broken links/improper code.

Horiseon is one of the country's fastest growing software companies, specializing in SEO and marketing. Their beautiful website allows the user to comprehensively and quickly become acquianted with all of their services.
