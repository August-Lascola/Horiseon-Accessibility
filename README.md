# Project Title

This project is my very first coding project. It's fairly simple in nature--I was asked to make the website more accessible and clean up the code. This involved properly formatting elements, adding semantic elements, commenting to organize the CSS file, and fixing broken links/improper code.

Horiseon is one of the country's fastest growing software companies, specializing in SEO and marketing. Their beautiful website allows the user to comprehensively and quickly become acquianted with all of their services. 

Along the way I learned a lot--going in my experience was next-to-nothing. I used basic HTML and CSS and also became acquainted with Git/GitHub/Git Bash. I had a big setback after I had polished my code--my URL wasn't properly deploying and I ended up messing around with too many things. The entire time, my file structure was off. Lesson learned. Really happy it's back to working. 

### Prerequisites

Nothing--just click on the link in the "Deployment" section below to view the application. 



## Deployment

You can find the finished application at: https://august-lascola.github.io/Horiseon-accessibility/ 

For a reference on what the website should look like, please refer to the "Issues" tab for a screenshot I have provided. 

Some features you should test out: the links in the "nav bar" (Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing), resizing the window (this will be a skill I improve on in the following weeks--note how the nav bar collapses at a certain width).
